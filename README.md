# Calendar

1. 7/2/2024 TP1 started
2. 11/2/2024 TP1 corrig√© sent to tuteur and TP2 started

# Goals

* **Basic concepts of algorithms:** What are algorithms, their properties, and different types of algorithms like time and space complexity.
* **Problem-solving techniques:** How to design and analyze algorithms for solving different types of problems.
* **Data structures:** Different data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs, and how to use them efficiently in algorithms.
* **Algorithm analysis:** Techniques for analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms, including big O notation.
* **Sorting and searching algorithms:** Different algorithms for sorting and searching data, and their time and space complexity.
* **Graph algorithms:** Algorithms for traversing and manipulating graphs, like BFS and DFS.

# Change log

V1.0 Important functions were created on utile.c and main structure of main.c is added as well

V1.1 Bug fixes

V1.2 Until enumeration sort of TP1 is added. We also fixed some bugs on the utile.c

V1.3 Code updated for graphs creation and bug fixes

V1.4 Finsihing the coding for TP1 and bug fixes

V1.5 REAME updated

V1.6 Fixed some bugs and added tri_base_bis

V1.7 Final TP1

V1.8 Some bug fixes for TP1

V2.1 Exo1 of TP2 completed and Exo2 until Q2-2 completed

V2.2 Exo3 started. G3-1 has been completed. We need to move on the part G2-3 as well.

V2.3 Finished TP2

V3.1 Exercise 1 TP 3 completed

V3.2 Exercise 2 TP3 completed

V3.3 corrections on TP3 and mainly completed

V3.4 Last fixes for TP3

V3.5 TP3 completed

V4.0 Base code was added/created

V4.1 Project started. The 1.1 has been completed partially. The base cases work but when we check for a more complex one, the answers are not the best.

V4.2 Corrections, bug fixes and compte rendu completed until Question 7

V4.3 Question 8 answered and we started the read_file function for the propagation program asked on question 9. Many things need to be done in order for 1st stage of the project to be completed:

* [ ] Finish the read_file function (and its organisation)
* [ ] Write the colorization's algorithm logic in C
  * [ ] Use the T function maybe to analyse line by line
* [ ] Create an initialization function for the gred according to the M and N read from the file (setting every case to DEFAULT because in the beginning it's not colorised)
* [ ] See how to treat the colorisation in general

V4.4 Tests for file's decodation have been passed. AN initialisation function of grid and main program for part 1.3 have been completed. Only the treating algorithm remains

V4.5 Algorithm for Q9 has been completed but it's not working properly. Probably there is an index issue or something. Needs to be tested with the debuging tools. Moreover needs to be checked the case where we input a file name that is not at all acppeted (it doesn't exist) but the program instead of doing what it is supposed to do (say that opening the file is imposisble), instead it prints the rest of the UI.

V4.6 The program has been completed in a great percentage

V4.7 The color_llineORcolumn needs some corrections for 0.txt and the rest on the logic

V4.9 The algorithm (v3 and v2) are much better but they do not return exactly the correct solution. There should be an error somewhere.

V4.10 Updated fuction T. We need now to fix the issue with the v3 function doesn't colour correctly all the cases.

V4.11 Updated function T but still not finished yet. There are some errors

V4.12 Code correction on logic

V4.13 Optimization, formalization and completion

V4.16 Final optimisations before complete formalisation
