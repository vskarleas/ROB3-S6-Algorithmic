# Calendar

1. 7/2/2024 TP1 started
2. 11/2/2024 TP1 corrig√© sent to tuteur and TP2 started

# Goals

* **Basic concepts of algorithms:** What are algorithms, their properties, and different types of algorithms like time and space complexity.
* **Problem-solving techniques:** How to design and analyze algorithms for solving different types of problems.
* **Data structures:** Different data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs, and how to use them efficiently in algorithms.
* **Algorithm analysis:** Techniques for analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms, including big O notation.
* **Sorting and searching algorithms:** Different algorithms for sorting and searching data, and their time and space complexity.
* **Graph algorithms:** Algorithms for traversing and manipulating graphs, like BFS and DFS.

# Change log

* V1.0 Important functions were created on utile.c and main structure of main.c is added as well
* V1.1 Bug fixes
* V1.2 Until enumeration sort of TP1 is added. We also fixed some bugs on the utile.c
* V1.3 Code updated for graphs creation and bug fixes
* V1.4 Finsihing the coding for TP1 and bug fixes
* V1.5 REAME updated
* V1.6 Fixed some bugs and added tri_base_bis
* V1.7 Final TP1
* V1.8 Some bug fixes for TP1
* V2.1 Exo1 of TP2 completed and Exo2 until Q2-2 completed
* V2.2 Exo3 started. G3-1 has been completed. We need to move on the part G2-3 as well.
* V2.3 Finished TP2
* V3.1 Exercise 1 TP 3 completed
