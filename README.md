1. 7/2/2023 TP1 started

# Goals

* **Basic concepts of algorithms:** What are algorithms, their properties, and different types of algorithms like time and space complexity.
* **Problem-solving techniques:** How to design and analyze algorithms for solving different types of problems.
* **Data structures:** Different data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs, and how to use them efficiently in algorithms.
* **Algorithm analysis:** Techniques for analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms, including big O notation.
* **Sorting and searching algorithms:** Different algorithms for sorting and searching data, and their time and space complexity.
* **Graph algorithms:** Algorithms for traversing and manipulating graphs, like BFS and DFS.
